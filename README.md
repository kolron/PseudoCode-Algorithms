# PsuedoCode repository for popular Algorithms

Hi! in this repository I have some (And will continue to add!) PsuedoCode for popular algorithms and some of their implications.

All code here is PsuedoCode, might make a dedicated implementation in the future for each code!
Psuedo code varies in both Style and Syntax, so adapt according to your needs and likings.

Feel free to learn from my code and implement it. BUT I do not take responsibility for any usage you might do with it!
